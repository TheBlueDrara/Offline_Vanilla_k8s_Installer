    run the Connect_vm function after setting up a control panel node

run Check_node
    if kubeadm and kubelet are not present => run Install_k8s function, that will run install process and will install control panel node, and loopback to Check_node, and if everything is ok and its a master node it will exit the function and run the Connect_vm function
        if tools are present => check if kubelet is active
            if kubelet is not active => run Install_k8s function, that will run install process and will install control panel node, and loopback to Check_node, and if everything is ok and its a master node it will exit the function and run the Connect_vm function
            if kubelet is running => Check what kind of node is that
                if control plane node => run Install_optional_tools function, exit function at the end and run the Connect_vm function
                if worker node => run Update_node function and run Connect_vm function to connect to the next machine


# There is a loop, that always chekcs the environment, and will install a control panel node if k8s is not present in the beginning \
# and if it is present, check what kind of node, if master node, and everything works, hop to the next machine \
# if worker node, update the worker node and hop to the next machine
